PsimagLite contains utilities for use in codes for the simulation of strongly correlated electrons.
It is inspired in T.S.'s Psimag software (but PsimagLite is not a fork of Psimag).
The amount of functionality included in PsimagLite will be exactly this (subject to change):

ModuleName	Description
[Misc]	PSIMAGAssert.h
[LinearAlgebra]	Includes BLAS/LAPACK wrappers, Matrix.h and a new Vector.h class.
[Json] 	Json support (taken from M.S.'s new implementation which doesn't depend on anything at all)
[Xml] 	Xml support (M.S.'s Tag*.h files) I will include but not maintain this.
[Io]	Brandnew and fresh input output support
[Concurrency]	Concurrency classes taken from DCA++ (gbranch)
[SystemInfo]	Basic time/date capability, os, hostname, compiler info
[Profiling]	Profiling through constructor/destructor paradigm as done by M.S in DCA++
[RandomNumberGenerator]	Will include a good rng and a bad one/easy one for testing
[Interpolation] Akima splines

The reason for PsimagLite is to share code among SpinPhononFermion, DCA++ and DMRG++, Lanczos++, and FreeFermions. 

PsimagLite is free software (see file LICENSE) 

PsimagLite and DMRG++
Users now need to download PsimagLite before compiling DMRG++.
Note that PsimagLite is just a series of classes and needs no compilation (unless you want to use the drivers)
Developers should notice that common code will migrate from DMRG++ into PsimagLite.

PsimagLite and SpinPhononFermion
Same as DMRG++ above, except that PsimagLite is still not a requirement for SpinPhononFermion.
