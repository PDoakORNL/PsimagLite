-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PsimagLite is a collection of C++ classes that are common to 
 codes for the simulation of strongly correlated electrons.
PsimagLite is inspired in T.S.'s Psimag software (but PsimagLite is not a fork of Psimag).

The reason for PsimagLite is to share code among different applications.
Applications that depend on PsimagLite are:
SpinPhononFermion, DMRG++, Lanczos++, FreeFermions, and GpusDoneRight.

[DenseLinearAlgebra]
BLAS // wrapper
Lapack <-- Temporary class, do not use, use LAPACK instead
LAPACK // wrapper
Matrix /// a matrix class

[SparseLinearAlgebra]
CrsMatrix
TridiagonalMatrix
LanczosSolver
ChebyshevSolver <-- experimental, not ready!
SparseRow <-- experimental, do not use

[JSON] 
JSON directory.
Json support (taken from M.S.'s new implementation which doesn't depend on anything at all)

[Io] Input output support
IoSimple

[Concurrency] To write the same code for serial and MPI (and in
the future pthreads and GPUs)
Concurrency
ConcurrencyMpi
ConcurrencySerial
Pthreads
NoPthreads
PackIndices
Range

[SystemInfo] Basic time/date capability, os, hostname, compiler info
HostInfo
MemoryUsage
Rusage // Rusage class is deprecated, use MemoryUsage instead
Profiling // Profiling through constructor/destructor paradigm as done by M.S in DCA++
It should be called actually scope
ProgressIndicator
Tokenizer
TypeToString
LineMarker

[Math]
LinearPrediction
Minimizer
PlotParams
Sort
Random48
RandomForTests
AkimaSpline
GslWrapper
Fermi
AlmostEqual
BitManip
ContinuedFractionCollection
ContinuedFraction

[STL extensions] These add operations to std classes and put those
extensions in the std namespace, no new classes here!
Complex
Vector
Stack
